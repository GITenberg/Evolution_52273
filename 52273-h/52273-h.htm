<p><span class="smcap">It</span> may appear a very rash thing for
any person who does not claim to be a man of science to presume
to give an opinion on any of the theories of scientific
men.&nbsp; But there is a vast difference between the facts of
science and the theories suggested for their explanation.&nbsp;
The facts are, as it were, the property of the
investigators.&nbsp; The investigators have a power of
investigation which we outsiders have not, and it would be folly
for us who have not that power to presume to call in question
their information.&nbsp; But it is a very different matter with
the theories either founded on these facts or invented to explain
them.&nbsp; When science has given us the facts common-sense can
discuss the theories founded on them; and, without presuming to
call in question the ascertained results of scientific
investigation, any person of ordinary intelligence may form his
own opinion as to the conclusions derived from the known
facts.&nbsp; The scientific men know the facts, and we do not;
but, when they have told us the facts, we can think as well as
they.&nbsp; This point was exceedingly well put by Canon Garbett
at the Norwich Church Congress in 1865.&nbsp; He said:
&ldquo;Beyond a certain point the conclusions and arguments of
the man of science cease to be exclusively his own, and become
the common property of all men.&nbsp; All argument rests on
common principles, and when once the facts of the case are
clearly ascertained, any man who is trained to reason correctly
is competent to judge of them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again: &ldquo;Let the
man of science,&rdquo; said Canon Garbett, &ldquo;reign supreme
within his own sphere, and let none but those trained in the same
school and learned in the same craft venture to dispute with him
as he gathers his facts and generalizes his rules.&nbsp; But when
all this is done, and he proceeds to reason, then it is
different.&nbsp; He steps out of his special department into a
sphere open to all men alike.&nbsp; Tell me what your facts are,
and if I sufficiently master them I am as competent to judge of
the validity of the conclusions drawn from them as the man of
science himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is scarcely any subject to which this principle applies
more completely than it does to Evolution; for what is called
&ldquo;the doctrine of Evolution&rdquo; is only a theory.&nbsp;
It is not a collection of facts, but a theory which some of its
warmest <a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>advocates&mdash;as, <i>e.g.</i>, Professor
Drummond&mdash;declare to be &ldquo;still unproved.&rdquo; <a
name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3"
class="citation">[3]</a>&nbsp; While, therefore, we fully
recognise that it would be the utmost folly &ldquo;to debate a
point of natural history with Darwin, or a question of
comparative anatomy with Owen,&rdquo; we may, by the aid of
common-sense, form an opinion possibly as sound at theirs on the
unproved theory which has been founded on the ascertained facts
which those great investigators have placed within our
reach.&nbsp; This is all that I would attempt to do in the
present paper.&nbsp; I do not propose to call in question a
single fact ascertained by men of science.&nbsp; All that I would
venture to do is to exercise the ordinary powers of thought in
considering one of the theories which some scientific men have
suggested as an explanation of those facts.&nbsp; I say
&ldquo;some scientific men,&rdquo; for there is a very great
difference of opinion amongst scientific men, and no one can read
the admirable papers produced by the Victoria Institute without
perceiving now much accurate observation, how wide a scientific
knowledge, and how great a force of Baconian philosophy is
arrayed against the theory just now in the fashion.</p>
<p>Let us begin, then, with a few facts respecting which we are
all agreed, and which as they are sometimes called by the name of
Evolution, are supposed to supply evidence of the correctness of
the theory.</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp; We all believe in <i>growth</i>.&nbsp; It is a
matter of fact that the world is full of growth.&nbsp; And this
growth is not limited to gradual, or continuous, enlargement or
development; but consists sometimes in most remarkable sudden
changes, as when the egg becomes a chicken, the caterpillar a
chrysalis, and the chrysalis a butterfly.&nbsp; Every living
creature, whether plant or animal, has its own mode of growth;
and no living creature is born into the world in the fulness of
its stature.&nbsp; The man was once in his cradle, the eagle in
its egg, the oak in its acorn; and no one can point to any living
thing, either in the animal or vegetable kingdom, that began life
with the full development of all the powers or properties of its
species.&nbsp; Whatever men may think of any theory, as a matter
of fact there is invariably growth as the first, and most
certain, accompaniment of life.</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; Within certain limits we all believe in
<i>variations</i>.&nbsp; Both plants and animals of the same
species vary according to circumstances, and are all more or less
affected by country, by climate, and by culture.&nbsp; Amongst
dogs, <i>e.g.</i>, there are countless varieties of breed, to say
nothing of all the mongrels.&nbsp; Just so amongst flowers; there
are countless varieties of the rose, and these varieties may be
multiplied to any extent by <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>culture.&nbsp; There is, moreover, a
power of adaptation to climate and other circumstances.&nbsp; In
colder climates animals of the same species have thicker coats
than they have under the tropics.&nbsp; There cannot be a
question that both plants and animals will begin at once, if
placed in a new position, to adapt themselves to it; and, as a
general rule, if they fail in such adaptation, they die.&nbsp;
Beyond all doubt, as a matter of fact, there are variations
resulting both from parentage and environment.&nbsp; We are told
by naturalists that some of these variations are not of a
permanent character, as, <i>e.g.</i>, in the case of pigeons, of
which it is stated by Darwin that any number of breeds, if left
to themselves, will in time revert to the common Rock.&nbsp; But
still the fact remains, that within certain limits there are
numberless variations, and that these variations may be
transmitted to posterity.&nbsp; Some of these appear to have been
produced in one way, and some in another; but, however produced,
there they are; and no one, whether scientific or unscientific,
can for one moment call in question the fact.</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; We all believe in <i>progression</i>.&nbsp; We see
progression all around us.&nbsp; It appears to be a universal law
that there should be perpetual movement.&nbsp; Sometimes there is
advance, and sometimes retrogression&mdash;but always movement;
for when there is no advance, there is invariably decline.&nbsp;
Then, again, as far as observation is concerned, we find this
progression gradual and continuous.&nbsp; Characters are
gradually formed; learning is gradually acquired; power is
gradually gained; and the whole world advances by the gradual
attainment of increasing knowledge.&nbsp; Such progression is
seen both in creation and revelation.</p>
<p>In Creation, for no one supposes that the world was created
and peopled by one instantaneous act of the Creator.&nbsp; There
may be difficulties in some of the commonly received
interpretations of some of the statements of that most wonderful
narrative contained in Gen. i.; but there can be no doubt
whatever that it teaches progression.&nbsp; It begins with chaos,
and leads us step by step to a perfected cosmos.&nbsp; At the
outset; &ldquo;the earth was waste, or without form, and void,
and darkness was upon the face of the deep.&rdquo;&nbsp; And at
the end we see a fertile world covered with vegetation, peopled
by countless living creatures, with man, in the image of God, at
their head, all enjoying the bright light of the sun in heaven;
and all in so perfect a condition that &ldquo;God saw everything
that He had made, and behold it was very good.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
this change did not take place by one solitary act.&nbsp; The
world did not leap by one bound from one condition to the
other.&nbsp; There were, according to Scripture no less than six
successive steps in the process.&nbsp; Let people explain the six
days as they please, and <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>I fully acknowledge that there may be
legitimate differences in their explanations.&nbsp; But no one
can doubt that the narrative teaches progression; and that,
according to that narrative, it pleased God by a series of
successive acts to complete the work which He pronounced to be
very good.&nbsp; No one, therefore, who believes in the Book of
Genesis can for one moment doubt progression in the work of the
creation.</p>
<p>Nor can there be the slightest doubt as to progression in
Revelation.&nbsp; Some people seem to speak of this as if it were
a new discovery connected with the theory of Evolution.&nbsp;
Such persons ought to read an admirable book called &ldquo;The
Philosophy of the Plan of Salvation,&rdquo; written many years
ago, and new published by the Religious Tract Society.&nbsp; It
is perfectly impossible to read through the Old and New
Testaments as a complete book without seeing progression.&nbsp;
It is deeply to be deplored that such a man as Professor Drummond
should have said, as he is reported to have said in his Sunday
lectures, at Grosvenor House, <a name="citation5a"></a><a
href="#footnote5a" class="citation">[5a]</a> &ldquo;The Book of
Genesis must be regarded as presenting truth to children&rsquo;s
minds;&rdquo; and should have illustrated this by George
Macdonald&rsquo;s poem, &ldquo;The Baby,&rdquo; adding,
&ldquo;not literally true, but true for the child.&nbsp; So Moses
gave truth in the form of a poem.&nbsp; If you say it is a
scientific book, I give it up; but if you regard it as a poem,
then I can deal with it.&rdquo;&nbsp; This appears to teach that
the Book of Genesis is regarded by him as something like a
nursery rhyme.&nbsp; But the report <a name="citation5b"></a><a
href="#footnote5b" class="citation">[5b]</a> is evidently
abridged; and I hope it is incorrect.&nbsp; We know that there
are sixty-six books in the Bible; but we also believe that it is
&ldquo;a Book&rdquo; complete in itself, and with all its parts
so beautifully proportioned that it forms one perfect whole for
the gradual development of the whole counsel of God.&nbsp; Thus
we believe that the one verse (Gen. iii 15), &ldquo;I will put
enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her
seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his
heel,&rdquo; is the seed, or germ, of the whole Gospel; and that
just as the oak is in the acorn, so in these few words is
contained the whole covenant of God.&nbsp; The first twelve
chapters of the Book of Genesis trace the pedigree of that seed
of the woman till the call of the chosen family in Abraham; the
historical books record the varied history of that family, and
show how sorely the heel of the woman&rsquo;s seed first bruised
by the serpent; while the prophecies enlarge, and expand the
blessed hope of final victory in the promised One.&nbsp; At
length the Gospels reveal the long-expected Christ; and the Acts
and the Epistles unfold the principles and progress of His
kingdom, till the whole is <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>complete in the Apocalypse, where we
read of &ldquo;the new heavens and the new earth,&rdquo; with the
curse of sin gone for ever, with Satan cast into the lake of
fire, and with the seed of the woman triumphant over death and
hell.&nbsp; As the acorn to the oak, so is that first promise to
the Apocalypse.&nbsp; It is no poem, no myth, no nursery rhyme,
but the germ of the whole counsel of God&mdash;a germ containing
the whole Gospel, and requiring no less than four thousand years
for its development.</p>
<p>Let no one suppose, therefore, for a moment that we do not
believe in progression, for we see it throughout nature; and we
find it distinctly taught in Scripture as a matter of historical
fact, both in creation and revelation.&nbsp; But the fact of
progression is a totally different thing from the theory of
Evolution; and it is extremely important that the distinction
should be carefully borne in mind; for there are many, and some
of them clear-headed men, who, because they see the three
things&mdash;growth, variation, and progression, avow themselves
believers in Evolution, though all the while they really reject
what should be strictly termed &ldquo;the Evolution
theory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What then is the theory of Evolution?&nbsp; What is it which
Bishop Temple describes as &ldquo;just at present the leading
scientific doctrine,&rdquo; <a name="citation6a"></a><a
href="#footnote6a" class="citation">[6a]</a> and for which he
says the evidence &ldquo;is enormously great, and increasing
daily&rdquo;? <a name="citation6b"></a><a href="#footnote6b"
class="citation">[6b]</a>&nbsp; It is extremely difficult to
answer the question; for evolutionists themselves, although they
are perpetually trumpeting forth the superiority of their
scientific accuracy, very seldom take the trouble to tell us what
they mean.&nbsp; In a defence of Mr. Drummond&rsquo;s book, in
the <i>Expositor</i>, the defender states, with reference to an
article of my own in the <span class="smcap">Churchman</span> of
February last, that there are at least four theories of
Evolution; and he also informs us which of the four it is that
Mr. Drummond teaches.&nbsp; It is a pity that Mr. Drummond did
not tell us this in his book, instead of leaving us to conclude,
as some of us have concluded that it was the doctrine of Mr.
Herbert Spencer that appeared to call forth his enthusiastic
admiration.</p>
<p>Bishop Temple speaks of &ldquo;<i>the</i> two theories of
Evolution;&rdquo; and what he does with the other two I do not
know.&nbsp; He describes the one as that of La Place, and the
other as that of Darwin; the former being a theory for the
construction of the universe, and therefore by some called
&ldquo;Cosmical Evolution;&rdquo; the other for the development
of vegetable and animal life, and therefore termed
&ldquo;Biological Evolution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To begin with the <i>Biological</i>.&nbsp; This is briefly
stated by <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>Bishop Temple <a name="citation7a"></a><a
href="#footnote7a" class="citation">[7a]</a> in the words:
&ldquo;It cannot be denied that Darwin&rsquo;s investigations
have made it extremely probable that the vast variety of plants
and animals have sprung from a much smaller number of original
forms.&rdquo;&nbsp; So Darwin, in his summary, <a
name="citation7b"></a><a href="#footnote7b"
class="citation">[7b]</a> writes: &ldquo;The several classes of
facts which have been considered in this chapter seem to me to
proclaim so plainly that the innumerable species, genera, and
families with which this world is peopled, are all descended,
each within its own class or group, from common parents, and have
all been modified in the course of descent, that I should without
hesitation adopt this view, even if it were unsupported by other
facts or arguments.&rdquo;&nbsp; I presume that there are very
few amongst us who would differ materially from either of these
statements; for both of them fully admit the original existence
of a variety of common parents, which is, in fact, a complete
surrender of the whole position; and Darwin limits the
modifications in the course of descent to changes, &ldquo;each
within its own class or group.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now this is all for
which the anti-evolutionist contends; for all admit most freely
the existence of most marked variations within the circles of the
various groups.</p>
<p>But, although in this passage there is this limitation, as a
matter of fact there is a great deal more claimed by both writers
for Evolution; for the title of Darwin&rsquo;s book, &ldquo;The
Origin of Species,&rdquo; shows very clearly that he applies his
theory not merely to variations within species, but to the
formation of the species within which these variations take
place.&nbsp; I do not gather from his book that his theory goes
so far as to suppose that either plants or animals have passed
over from one species to another, both species being already in
existence; but rather that through the power of &ldquo;the
struggle for existence,&rdquo; &ldquo;natural selection,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;survival of the fittest,&rdquo; existing races have
been so changed and modified that new species have been evolved
out of them, and that in every such evolution there has been what
evolutionists consider to be improvement.</p>
<p>The arguments which Bishop Temple adduces for this theory
are&mdash;</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp; &ldquo;The unity of plan which can be found
pervading any great class of animals seems to point to unity of
ancestry.&rdquo; <a name="citation7c"></a><a href="#footnote7c"
class="citation">[7c]</a>&nbsp; He illustrates this by remarking
that vertebrate animals are formed on a common plan.</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; &ldquo;Slight variations are perpetually being
produced.&rdquo; <a name="citation7d"></a><a href="#footnote7d"
class="citation">[7d]</a></p>
<p>(3)&nbsp; &ldquo;The frequent occurrence both in plants or
animals of useless parts which still remain as indications of
organs that once were useful, and have long become
useless.&rdquo; <a name="citation7e"></a><a href="#footnote7e"
class="citation">[7e]</a></p>
<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>But is
this scientific evidence?&nbsp; As to the 1st, the Bishop only
claims for it that it &ldquo;<i>seems</i> to point.&rdquo;&nbsp;
As to the 2nd, it quietly assumes the whole point at issue, for
no one denies that there are variations &ldquo;within each class
or group,&rdquo; and the fact that such variations exist within a
certain class or group is no proof that they can extend beyond
it.&nbsp; And as for the 3rd who knows that those that are called
&ldquo;useless parts&rdquo; are really useless, though their use
may not be known?&nbsp; And if they are useless now, what
evidence is there that they were once useful, or were ever
used?&nbsp; There is not the slightest scientific evidence in any
one of these three points for the theory which they are adduced
to support.&nbsp; There is not a single fact to prove the theory,
and all that can be said by the most ardent advocate is that the
conjecture seems to be probable.&nbsp; But how different is the
evidence on the other side of the controversy!&nbsp; There we
find certain clearly-defined and indisputable facts which cannot
be doubted, and which cannot be reconciled with this new
theory.</p>
<h3>(1)&nbsp; <i>Biological Evolution</i>.</h3>
<p>There cannot be a doubt that there are certain great classes
of plants and animals found in the world, which have certain
distinct characteristics, and which, as a matter of fact, do not
merge into each other.&nbsp; There seems to be considerable
variation in the names given to them, and they appear to be
distinguished by the name sometimes of &ldquo;species,&rdquo;
sometimes of &ldquo;genus,&rdquo; sometimes of &ldquo;class or
group,&rdquo; and sometimes of &ldquo;kind.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the
sentence quoted from Darwin on p. 6, he speaks of species,
genera, and families; and describes them as being all descended
each within its own class or group.&nbsp; This confusion of terms
is difficult to reconcile with the boasted claim to scientific
accuracy.&nbsp; That I may not be entangled by any questionable
name I will distinguish these groups as A, B, C, D, etc., and our
question is whether they have been evolved from each other or
through each other, from a common stock; or whether they are
separate creations.&nbsp; For the answer to this question let
three facts be carefully considered.</p>
<p>(i.)&nbsp; There is the remarkable and clearly-established law
of the sterility of all hybrids between any two of these great
divisions.&nbsp; Both A and B may contain a great number of
varieties, and all the varieties of A can breed freely with each
other.&nbsp; In such case there is no failure of fertility in the
progeny.&nbsp; The same is true of B and all the varieties that
spring from it.&nbsp; If these varieties be expressed by the
figures 1, 2, 3, etc., A1 may breed with A2, A3, or any other
number, and so may introduce a fresh variety in the race A.&nbsp;
But if A, or any variation of A, should breed with B, or any
variation of B, there <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>may be in the first instance a
progeny; but there is a fixed and invariable law of nature that
there should be no perpetuation of that progeny, for every
individual so born is barren.&nbsp; Mules e.g., can never give
birth to mules, and the mule race has no power of
self-propagation.&nbsp; Now see how this bears on the subject of
Evolution.&nbsp; If B were evolved out of A, there would, of
course, be countless intermediate variations, and these
variations would all have the power of perpetuating their
kind.&nbsp; A would produce A1, A1 would produce A2, and so on,
till A98 would produce A99, and, finally, to complete the series,
A99 would produce A100, or B.&nbsp; But at this point, if the
Evolution theory is to be reconciled with facts, a new and most
strange law must be suddenly evolved; and the continuity of law
must be broken.&nbsp; A98 may breed with A99, and their offspring
may perpetuate their race; but if A99 should breed with A100,
which is B, it is true there may be offspring, but that offspring
will bare no power of self-perpetuation.&nbsp; How can
evolutionism explain such a fracture in the continuity of
law?&nbsp; And is not the scientific fact dead against the
Evolution theory?</p>
<p>(ii.)&nbsp; As a matter of fact we do not find that continuous
chain of intermediate links which the theory requires.&nbsp; The
theory is, that as there are to be no sudden jumps in nature, the
various numbers are evolved from each other in a vast series of
almost imperceptible improvement; and it follows of necessity
that, if the theory were true, instead of finding distinct
classes, we should find various lines of progress stealing into
each other in steps so minute that it would be very difficult to
detect their differences.&nbsp; If, <i>e.g.</i>, man has been
evolved from monkey there ought not to be a yawning chasm, as
there now is, between the two, but there ought to be a vast
series of connecting links bridging the chasm between monkeyism
and manhood; and there ought to be a race of monkeys still
existing so near to man in physical structure and mental power
that the birth of man from such a parentage should be within the
range of natural probability.&nbsp; Let A be monkey, and B man,
then there ought to be a continuous line of intermediate numbers,
and A99 ought to approximate so closely to B that it would be
perfectly natural for B to be its child.</p>
<p>But where are these links to be found? and what naturalist can
discover them?&nbsp; If the theory be true, the process must
still be going on, and the world must be teeming with these
intermediate races.&nbsp; But where are they?&nbsp; Bishop Temple
as attempted to answer this question thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>If it be asked why this variety does not range by
imperceptible degrees from extreme forms in one direction to
extreme forms in the other, the answer is to be found in the
enormous prodigality, and the equally <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>enormous waste of life and living
creatures . . .&nbsp; Eggs, and seeds, and germs are destroyed by
millions, and so in a less but still enormous proportion are the
young that come from those that have not been destroyed.&nbsp;
There is no waste like the waste of life that is to be seen in
nature . . .&nbsp; The inevitable operation of this waste, as
Darwin&rsquo;s investigation showed, has been to destroy all
those varieties which were not well fitted to their surroundings,
and to keep those that were. (P. 165.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But if this be the solution of the difficulty, how is it that
those at the bottom of the scale remain?&nbsp; One of the great
principle employed to explain the theory is &ldquo;the survival
of the fittest.&rdquo;&nbsp; The result therefore must be
continuous progress, and the <i>raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> of
each successive formation is its superior fitness above the form
from which it sprang.&nbsp; A1 survives because it is superior in
fitness to A, and A2 because it is superior to A1, and so
forth.&nbsp; The effect therefore of the Bishop&rsquo;s principle
would be that the inferior forms at the bottom of the scale would
perish, while the superior that have risen out of them, by reason
of their greater adaptation to their environment, would
survive.&nbsp; But this is not the fact.&nbsp; As a matter of
fact, A, at the bottom of the scale, survives, though A99, at the
top, is gone.&nbsp; The countless multitude of intermediate
formations has disappeared, but the parent stock remains.&nbsp;
If ever there was a race of animals so near man as to render it
nothing more than natural that it should give birth to man, that
race has wholly disappeared, while animals vastly inferior still
exist in all their strength.&nbsp; Such a fact appears to me to
be fatal to the theory.</p>
<p>(iii.)&nbsp; But the geological evidence is stronger
still.&nbsp; If all these creatures have arisen in succession,
and perished, we may well ask, &ldquo;Where are their
bones?&rdquo;&nbsp; Each successive race, according to the
theory, has been sufficiently powerful to overpower its
predecessors, and to reproduce its own kind.&nbsp; It is clear,
therefore, that we should naturally look for the geological
remains of those once-powerful animals.&nbsp; But here we are met
by the hard, stubborn, rocky fact, that there is no trace of them
in the geological record.&nbsp; We find the remains of A, B, C,
D, etc., but between them there is a complete hiatus; and if
there were 1000 links between A and B, the geologist cannot show
you one of them.&nbsp; He can show you A, and he can show you B;
but as for A 20, 30, and 40, he can only tell you that they are
not yet discovered.&nbsp; I know that some good Christian people
are afraid of geology, and in that I believe they make a great
mistake; for though I grant there may be danger in shallow,
superficial, theoretical geology, I never can doubt that the real
record of the rocks is in perfect harmony with the real record of
Scripture.&nbsp; So, in this instance, it has furnished us with
an unanswerable proof that the evolutionist theory is not founded
in fact, and that <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>nothing has yet been discovered in the geological record
to shake our confidence in the grand, old, Scriptural statement,
&ldquo;God made the beast of the earth after its kind, and the
cattle after their kind, and everything that creepeth upon the
ground after its kind: and God saw that it was good.&rdquo;&nbsp;
We all know that it is not the object of the Book of Genesis to
teach science; and some, I grieve to think, are not afraid of
calling it a myth, or even a poem for the childhood of the world;
but I venture to affirm that the statement of the Inspired Book
which describes each kind as a separate creation is more in
accordance with well-known geological facts, and is therefore
more scientifically accurate than the theories of those who adopt
the conjecture that the various kinds, species, or groups evolved
themselves either from each other or from a common stock.</p>
<h3>(2)&nbsp; <i>Cosmical Evolution</i>.</h3>
<p>But if this be the case with Biological Evolution, how is it
with Cosmical Evolution, or the evolution of inanimate
matter?&nbsp; Bishop Temple describes it as &ldquo;that which
begins with Laplace, and explains the way in which the earth was
fitted to be the habitation of living creatures;&rdquo; <a
name="citation11a"></a><a href="#footnote11a"
class="citation">[11a]</a> and again he says: <a
name="citation11b"></a><a href="#footnote11b"
class="citation">[11b]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>It cannot, then, be well denied that the
astronomers and geologists here made it exceedingly probable that
this earth on which we live has been brought to its present
condition by passing through a succession of changes from an
original state of great heat and fluidity, perhaps even from a
mixture mainly consisting of gases; that such a body as the
planet Jupiter represents one of the stages through which it has
passed; that such a body as the moon represents a stage toward
which it is tending; that it has shrank as it cooled, and as it
shrank formed the elevations which we call mountains, and the
depressions which contain the seas and oceans; that it has been
worn by the action of heat from within and water from without,
and in consequence of this action presents the appearance when
examined below the surface of successive strata or layers; that
different kinds of animal and vegetable life have followed one
another on the surface, and that some of their remains are found
in these strata now: and that all this has taken enormous periods
of time.&nbsp; All this is exceedingly probable, because it is
the way in which, as Laplace first pointed out, under well
established scientific laws of matter, particularly the law of
gravitation and the law of the radiation of heat, a great fluid
mass would naturally change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is nothing in that explanation to militate against the
Scriptural accounts of the formation of the present world; and it
may have pleased God to make use of the laws of gravitation and
radiation of heat in order to bring our world into its present
form.&nbsp; But the structure of the earth is not all, or nearly
all.</p>
<p>There is found on the earth, and within it, an infinite
variety of substances.&nbsp; There are metals; such as gold,
silver, lead, <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>iron, etc.&nbsp; There are precious stones of gorgeous
beauty, diamonds, rubies, etc., etc.&nbsp; There is vegetable
matter of every description, from the tenderest blade of grass to
the hard wood of the forest oak.&nbsp; And there are animals of
all classes and all characters, from the lowest mollusk to the
most perfect and elaborate vertebrate.&nbsp; And the question is,
What made them?&nbsp; Were they produced by the cooling of the
earth?&nbsp; Was it gravitation or radiation that made the gold,
the ruby, the fern, the oak, the animal, and the water?</p>
<p>But in addition to these various substances, the world abounds
with what we call &ldquo;Laws.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are the laws of
electricity, of heat, of chemistry, of force, of motion, etc.;
besides those to which all these great changes are ascribed, the
laws of heat and gravitation&mdash;and, What made them?&nbsp; Are
they all the result of the cooling of the earth?&nbsp; Was one
mass of fluid matter cooled into iron, one into gold, one into
wood, and one into flesh? and did they all evolve from themselves
by some mysterious power, those wonderful laws of nature to which
they are all subject and which they all obey?&nbsp; In their case
there was no &ldquo;struggle for existence,&rdquo; no
&ldquo;survival of the fittest,&rdquo; and no &ldquo;natural
selection&rdquo;&mdash;no thought, no mind, no design, and no
plan in themselves; and it is indeed hard to suppose that they
not only evolved themselves, but also evolved laws of such
marvellous subtlety and power, that their discovery and use form
the greatest achievement of modern science.</p>
<p>It may perhaps interest some to know how it is all supposed to
have been done, and as Mr. Herbert Spencer appears to be the
great apostle of the theory, I will give, in his own words, the
conclusion of his elaborate argument.&nbsp; In &ldquo;First
Principles&rdquo; (p. 396) he gives his great conclusion, and
prints it in italics that there may be no mistake as to its vast
importance: &ldquo;Evolution,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is an
integration of matter and concomitant dissipation of motion,
during which the matter passes from an indefinite, incoherent
homogeneity to a definite, coherent heterogeneity, and during
which the retained motion undergoes a parallel
transformation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Is it for such as that that we are
to give up our faith in the creation of God?</p>
<p>But this is not all, for not merely is the earth filled with
various substances, and governed by various laws; but there is a
third element for which even Mr. Spencer&rsquo;s definition fails
to account, and that is life.&nbsp; There is life abounding
everywhere; but what science can tell us either what it is or
whence it came?&nbsp; Was it produced either by gravitation or
radiation?&nbsp; Did the cooling of the earth produce life on its
surface?&nbsp; I know no greater evidence of the utter failure of
the evolutionist theory than the suggestion made on one occasion
(I <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>think
in an inaugural address to the British Association), that life
came in a meteoric stone from some already formed habitable
world.&nbsp; With reference to such an idea it is enough to ask
four questions.&nbsp; How did it get into that other world?&nbsp;
How did it attach itself to the meteoric stone?&nbsp; How did it
survive the awful blow which it must have experienced when it
struck the earth? and how did it spread itself when it found
itself alone in the utter loneliness of an uninhabited
world?&nbsp; Such is the theory of those who would struggle to
create a world without a God; and I venture to affirm that there
is infinitely more true science in the words, &ldquo;All things
were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was
made.&nbsp; In Him was life, and the life was the light of
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, though I have thus followed Bishop Temple in his twofold
division of the theory of Evolution, there is another twofold
division which I regard as of incomparably greater
importance.&nbsp; I refer to the Theistic and Atheistic
theory.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; There is a Theistic theory, for there can be no doubt
whatever that many of those who accept the Evolution theory hold
it in the firm belief in the creative power of a self-existing
Creator.&nbsp; Bishop Temple, <i>e.g.</i>, states the question
thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the one case the Creator made the animals at
once such as they now are; in the other case He impressed on
certain particles of matter, which either at the beginning or at
some point in the history of His creation He endowed with life,
such inherent powers that in the ordinary course of time living
creatures such as the present were developed.&nbsp; The creative
power remains the same in either case. <a
name="citation13"></a><a href="#footnote13"
class="citation">[13]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For my own part, I should be almost disposed to consider that
the creative power was the greater on the theory of Evolution;
for to make a germ which should evolve itself into all the
countless varieties, both of animate and inanimate existence, is,
if possible, a greater miracle than the creation of each separate
species.&nbsp; There is great skill shown in the manufacture both
of a railway train and a steamboat, but the skill would be of a
much higher order if a person were to construct a train with its
engine and all its carriages, and impart to it the remarkable
property that when it arrived at the sea-coast it should of
itself without the action of man, turn itself into a
steamboat.</p>
<p>Thus a person may hold the Evolution theory to its fullest
extent without entertaining the slightest doubt as to the
creative power of our God.&nbsp; Indeed, Bishop Temple says:</p>
<blockquote><p>The doctrine of Evolution leaves the argument for
an intelligent Creator and Governor of the world stronger than it
was before.&nbsp; There is still as much as ever the proof of an
intelligent purpose pervading all creation.&nbsp; The difference
is that the execution of that purpose <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>belongs more to the original act of
creation, less to acts of government since.&nbsp; There is more
Divine foresight, there is less Divine interposition; and
whatever has been taken from the latter has been added to the
former. (P. 122.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is such a joy in the blessed assurance of Divine
interposition, and it seems so clearly taught in Scripture, that
it is impossible to regard without the utmost jealousy the
suggestion of even such a transfer as that described in these
words.&nbsp; But still, however greatly we may regret the theory,
we are bound in justice to recognise the fact that those who hold
it may believe in a Creator God with a faith as firm and unshaken
as that which brings peace to our own souls.</p>
<p>I cannot refrain from adding that this was the view of Darwin
himself.&nbsp; He has been claimed as an ally by those who deny
the creation of God; so that it is most satisfactory to read such
a passage as that with which his book concludes:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is grandeur in this view of life, with its
several powers, having been originally breathed <span
class="smcap">by the Creator</span> into a few forms or into one;
and that whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the
fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms,
most beautiful and most wonderful, have been and are being
evolved. (P. 429.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We may wholly differ from him in his theory of Evolution, but
we rejoice to agree with him in the conviction that life, was
originally breathed forth by the Creator.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; But there is also an Atheistic theory of Evolution,
which does, in fact, substitute Evolution for God.&nbsp; The
doctrine of Evolution is used, according to Bishop Temple,
&ldquo;to prove that no intelligence planned the
world.&rdquo;&nbsp; The theory seems to be that through the power
of certain laws the original atoms have gradually evolved
themselves into all the beauties and endless varieties of this
thickly-peopled world.&nbsp; It is pitiable to see the hopeless
shifts to which intelligent men are driven in order to maintain
such a theory.&nbsp; They are compelled to face the questions,
&ldquo;Whence came the atoms? and now did the laws
originate?&rdquo;&nbsp; And Mr. Herbert Spencer for an answer to
such questions is compelled to resort to what he terms &ldquo;The
Persistence of Force.&rdquo;&nbsp; We might push the inquiry one
step farther, and inquire what was the origin of this Persistence
of Force? and we cannot but wonder that a man who is considered
one of the great thinkers of the age should not be compelled,
when thus driven into a corner, to acknowledge with candour that
his persistent force is nothing less than the omnipotence of
God.&nbsp; But no, he cannot admit the existence of a God, and in
a note on p. 192 of his &ldquo;First Principles,&rdquo; he
actually tells us that he and Professor Huxley invented the term
&ldquo;Persistence of Force,&rdquo; instead of what used to be
the term employed, &ldquo;Conservation of Force,&rdquo; because
&ldquo;Conservation <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>implies a Conserver,&rdquo; and that he denies.&nbsp;
Thus his theory of Evolution is employed to show how the world
evolved itself without the interference of a Creator, or even a
Conserver of Force.&nbsp; The whole thing is supposed to have
been done without design, without plan, without intelligence,
without skill, and in fact without any action of mind or
intelligent power.&nbsp; The whole is supposed to be the result
of certain unintelligent laws, not ordained by any Lawgiver, or
carried out by any Conserver.&nbsp; In other words, the Evolution
theory is the Atheist&rsquo;s substitute for God.</p>
<p>Now surely, if this be the case, those who write and speak in
favour of the Evolution theory ought to be much more careful than
some of them have been in defining what they are speaking
of.&nbsp; Some of them speak of &ldquo;the doctrine of
Evolution,&rdquo; as if there was only one doctrine, and some
speak in most rapturous terms of its most extraordinary
value&mdash;as, <i>e.g.</i>, when Mr. Drummond said in Grosvenor
House that &ldquo;It was the Great thought of the century,
perhaps the greatest the world has ever found out;&rdquo; but
surely when they do so they are bound to tell us what they
mean.&nbsp; Do they mean simply growth? or progression? or
variation within species?&nbsp; Or do they mean evolution from
species to species? or the evolution of the inanimate
world?&nbsp; On such points there ought to be a clear and
unmistakable definition.&nbsp; Above all, do they mean an
evolution by God, or without Him?&nbsp; An evolution by the
design of a divine Person, or by &ldquo;Persistence of
Force,&rdquo; whatever that may be?&nbsp;
&ldquo;Evolution,&rdquo; in the vocabulary of Mr. Spencer and his
followers, means nothing less than a theory for the formation of
the world and all things therein, without the action or design of
a personal Creator; and surely it is to be deeply deplored that
Christian advocates should employ exactly the same term without
the slightest caution or protest.&nbsp; I do not say that in
their writings there are no passages which, if carefully
collected and spliced together, may indicate what they
mean.&nbsp; But what I maintain is, that as the word
&ldquo;Evolution&rdquo; is employed by them to express the mode
according to which our Heavenly Father has formed the whole
creation, both animate and inanimate, and by Atheists to express
the mode by which the world is supposed to have formed itself,
they ought not to use the word without making it as clear as the
sun in heaven in what sense they employ it.&nbsp; They may speak
of &ldquo;Evolution&rdquo; as the great scientific theory of the
day, or as the greatest achievement of the age, and unless they
are much more careful than some have been, their authority may be
quoted as endorsing the theory invented by Atheists and
maintained by them in support of their Atheism.&nbsp; Men&rsquo;s
minds are governed by words, and surely we have a right to ask of
those who glory <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>in scientific accuracy that they should clearly define
what they mean, and not leave their unscientific readers to
discover, as best they may, whether they wish us to believe in
self-evolution or Divine formation; in a self-evolution by
Persistence of Force, or in a marvellous creation by the design,
the skill, and the omnipotence of God.&nbsp; If they write about
Evolution in the loose way in which some have done lately while
they appear to speak with admiration of Mr. Herbert
Spencer&rsquo;s philosophy, they cannot be surprised if they are
regarded as teaching his Evolution theory, and if the effect of
their writing is to weaken faith and strengthen Atheism.</p>
<p>But let no one suppose for one moment that, because we deplore
the loose, inaccurate, and unscientific manner in which some of
those who glory in their scientific accuracy appear to confound
fact and theory, on that account we undervalue scientific
investigations, or think lightly of scientific facts.&nbsp; In
proof of this I would conclude this paper by an extract from the
writings of a truly scientific investigator, the late Mr. F.
Buckland, who writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Of late years, the doctrines of so-called
Evolution and Development have seemingly gained ground among
those interested in natural history; but to put matters very
straight, I steadfastly believe that the Great Creator, as indeed
we are directly told, made all things perfect and &ldquo;very
good&rdquo; from the beginning; perfect and very good every
created thing is now found to be, and will so continue to the
end.&nbsp; I am very willing to prove my case, by holding a court
at any time or place, before any number of people of any
class.&nbsp; I would impanel a jury of the most eminent and
skilful railway and mechanical engineers, while the only
witnesses I should call would be the fish fresh from the deep-sea
trawler, the city fish market, or the fishmonger&rsquo;s slab: I
would adduce from them evidence of &ldquo;design, beauty, and
order,&rdquo; as evinced in such as the electric organs of the
torpedo, the gun-lock spine of the file-fish, the water-reservoir
and spectacles of the eel, the teeth of the gilt-head bream, the
anchor of the lump-sucker and remora, the colouring of the perch
and bleak, the ichthyophagous teeth of the pike, shark, and
silvery hair-tail; the tail of the fox shark, the prehensile lips
of the dory and sprat, the nose of the barbel and dogfish, the
resplendence of the arctic gymnetrus and scabbard-fish, the
dagger in the tail of the sting-ray, the nest of the stickleback,
the armour-plates of the sturgeon, the nostril-breathing powers
and store of fat in the salmon; migrations of the salmon,
herring, pilchard, sprat, and mackerel; and, above all, the
enormous fertility of fishes useful as food to the human
race.&nbsp; I am satisfied that I should obtain a verdict in
favour of my view of the case, namely, that in all these
wonderful contrivances there exists evidence of design and
forethought, and a wondrous adaptation of means to an end.

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
